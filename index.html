  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Oddiah Opeyemi Jude (born August 2), popularly known as Joquarter is a Nigerian Rapper, Singer-Songwriter, Record Producer, Audio Engineer and Entrepreneur. Born and raised in Kwara State (From Edo State) Joquarter has always been a lover of music which strayed him to make a career out of it, He started music at a very tender age which was what made his popularity spread like wild fire that can’t be quenched. He was part of a music group in his secondary school days, it was at that stage in his life he discerned his exceptional gift of rapping and singing without inking on paper. Yes, he doesn’t pen on paper or thumb on any gadgets while writing his music, he stores everything upstairs. It was for this reason he decided to carve his own niche in the music scene and as well, discovering his full potential as a performer and a recording artist.

He studied Geography and Environmental Management in University of Ilorin.

“Joquarter” became an household name with his constant release of songs and I could say, music flows in the family for his mom was once a dancer who represented Nigeria in Berlin and other prominent places while his dad happens to be a music fanatic.

He’s currently flying his own independent imprint HUMBLE CHIEFS..</p>
